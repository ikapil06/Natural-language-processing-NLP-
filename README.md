# Sentiment Analysis by Flask App

Welcome to my NLP (Natural Language Processing) project!

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Flask web application for performing sentiment analysis on text data. The goal is to apply NLP techniques to analyze and classify the sentiment of user reviews or input text.

## My Learning Journey
This project is a living document of my NLP learning journey. I will continuously update this repository with new techniques, models, and insights as I explore and learn more about NLP. Expect regular updates as I:
- Experiment with different NLP models and algorithms
- Add new features to the Flask app
- Document key learnings, challenges, and solutions
- Share resources and references that help me grow

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ikapil06/Natural-language-processing-NLP-.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Natural-language-processing-NLP-/sentiment_analysis_by_flask_app
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to use the app.

## Folder Structure
- `app.py` - Main Flask application
- `data/` - Dataset(s) used for sentiment analysis
- `templates/` - HTML templates for the web interface
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Stay Tuned
I will keep updating this project as I learn more about NLP. Feel free to follow along, suggest improvements, or contribute!
